# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) using the theme
[astro-portfolio](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/portfolio).

## Blog

I create new pages for blog posts in the `src/pages/blog` directory.
The blog posts are written in TypeScript and use the `BlogPost` component.
This is the way I can use the same layout for all blog posts, using only Astro, Typescript,
vanilla CSS and no other libraries.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

| `pnpm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
