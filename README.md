# 🌐 Personal Website

[![Built with Astro](https://astro.badg.es/v1/built-with-astro.svg)](https://astro.build)

This is my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) using the theme
[astro-portfolio](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/portfolio).

## 📝 Blog

I create new pages for blog posts in the `src/pages/blog` directory.
The blog posts are written using only Astro, Typescript, vanilla CSS and no other libraries.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
